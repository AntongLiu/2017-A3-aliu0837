The web app is called TuesdayStudyï¼Œbecause Tuesday is considered to be the most productive day for learning and productivity.

# Description
The web application is designed to assist high school and university students with time management and task management.

It includes Pomodoro Timer, Positive Timer, To Do List, Reading List and Music Player, which can meet the basic needs of users.

During the initial research phase, I found that 27% of the respondents had used the Pomodoro timer, and 72% of them said it helped them improve their learning efficiency. In addition, 61% of the respondents said they would recommend this learning method to their classmates and friends.Therefore, I set the Pomodoro timer as the main function.

In addition, the forward timer is a basic function. I combined it with the Pomodoro timer into one interface, which greatly improves the efficiency of use. Users only need to click the logo icon in other interfaces to return to the main page (timer page).

In addition, I chose a classic light music song as the background music to help users soothe their mood and concentrate on their studies. Users can turn on or off background music by clicking the sound icon on the page.

The user clicks the floating icon on the left side of the page to pop up the to-do list. And when using this function, it will not affect the normal operation of the timer.

Unlike other features, reading lists require the user to concentrate on reading text. Therefore, I designed the page to be black on white.

# Iterations
![](../../Desktop/img-readme/1.jpg)
Through user usability research, more than 3 users indicated that they felt it was necessary to know the current progress, which motivated them to persevere.

When the background music is on, the icon turns green, which is more efficient to use.

Add a timer end beep and have the sound stop automatically after 3s.

Add delete button to task list.

Users do not need to fill in the full information to save a to-do list. (Some users say that filling in too much information affects their efficiency.)

The date does not need to be filled in manually by the user.

Users can adjust the length of study themselves, this is because several users have said that 25 minutes of study time is not enough. Being interrupted in the middle of a study session can affect their learning efficiency.
